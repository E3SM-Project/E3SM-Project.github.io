# Publishing

The E3SM Project has a policy to publish all official simulation campaigns once those simulations are documented in publications. If you are E3SM staff, refer to step 3 in [Simulation Data Management](https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/1159594096) for guidance on requesting data publication.
